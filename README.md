# Fake Email Detection - README

## Overview

**Fake Email Detection** is a project aimed at identifying and flagging fraudulent email addresses. By leveraging advanced data validation techniques and machine learning algorithms, this system determines the authenticity of email addresses effectively. This project is developed as part of an internship with Mindshift Technologies.

---

## Features

- **Email Format Validation**: Ensures the email adheres to standard formatting rules.
- **Domain Check**: Confirms the domain’s existence and legitimacy.
- **Blacklist Comparison**: Cross-references known spam and fake email domain lists.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses predictive analysis to identify potential fake emails.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to input email addresses and receive real-time validation results.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - Regex: For email pattern matching
  - Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model
  - Flask: For web application framework
  - Pandas: For data handling and processing
- **Database**: SQLite for storing email and domain data
